## Driving Change: In the Blink for Safety

## Description
Distracted and fatigued driving poses widespread risks, impacting both individuals and society​.
This problem significantly impacts societal safety and well-being on a large scale​.
Our data analysis targets early signs of driver fatigue and mind wandering​
Anticipated outcomes: a potential 24% reduction in annual crashes, especially among inexperienced drivers, potentially saving lives and preventing injuries through active detection and post-drive feedback
